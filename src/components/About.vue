            Clearly the most important website of all time has arrived.  If you ever felt the need to obscure a link 
            to someone in a URL that <em>almost</em> reminds you of a late 90s webpage community, well you've found the place.
            If you create an account, you can create links based on the original "Neighborhoods" that Geocities was known for.
            Unfortunately I could not procure the "geocities.com" domain (nor the geocities.yahoo.com domain)... so it really is 
            a half-baked ieda.
